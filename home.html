            <p>
                I began this assignment by taking a look at a cacti-shopping website. My goal was to create two
                versions of this site so that I could test how people's shopping habits were affected by each
                layout. <br><br>
                You can take a look at my websites
                <a href="https://pacific-dawn-35735.herokuapp.com/">here</a>. Each version of the website shows up
                with a 50% chance, so refresh the page a few times until you see them both. I've also
                included screenshots of each below! <br><br>
            </p>

            <div class="d-flex flex-row flex-wrap align-items-center justify-content-center pt-3">
                <div class="d-flex flex-column pr-4">
                    <h5>Site A</h5>
                    <img src="site_a.png" class="castle">
                </div>

                <div class="d-flex flex-column">
                    <h5>Site B</h5>
                    <img src="site_b.png" class="castle">
                </div>
            </div>

            <br>
            <p>
                Needless to say, there are some key differences between the two sites. Site A shows 
                the items in a 2x2 grid. Importantly, you can't even see the red 'cart'
                checkout button, because it is further down on the page. On the other hand, on Site B, 
                the items are in a single line and the checkout button is within view.<br><br>
                The rest of the project will go as follows: <br><br>
                <ol style="text-align: center; list-style-position: inside; padding-bottom: 2rem;">
                    <li>Hypothesis of user behavior on Site A vs. Site B</li>
                    <li>A discussion of the data collection process</li>
                    <li>Infographics illustrating the data results</li>
                    <li>Key takeaways from the experiment</li>
                </ol>
            </p>

	<div id="Hypothesis" class="usability">
		<h4 class=text-center>Hypothesis</h4>
		<div class="container-fluid">
            <hr class="mb-4">
            <p class="text-center"> My first step in this process was to make hypothesis that reflect
                the way the site's designs are different. I think my changes, as you will read below, lead 
                to some interesting conclusions.

            </p><br>
            <h5 class="text-center">Time to Completion:</h5>
            
           <p class="text-center">
               My null hypothesis is that the time to completion on Site A is the same as the time to
               completion on site B. My alternative hypothesis is that the time to completion is larger
               on Site A. I believe this because, on Site B, we see all of the items we can buy and the 
               checkout button on one page. People don't need to waste time scrolling to location the checkout button.
           </p>
            <br><br>
            <h5 class="text-center">Return Rate:</h5>
            <p class="text-center">
               Once again, my null hypothesis is that the return rate on Site A is the same as the return rate 
               on site B. My alternative hypothesis is that the return rate is higher
               on Site A. I believe this because, on Site A, we might accidentally checkout without realizing
               how much is in our cart. I think we are more likely to make this mistake on Site A because
               the checkout button is hidden and the counts for each item in the cart are organized in the 2x2
               form instead of linearly, as in Site B.

            <hr class="mb-4">
            <p class="text-center">
                After making my hypothesis, it was time to put them to the test. In order to do this, 
                I devised a scheme to collect data on my two sites. These are the steps I took:<br><br>
            </p>
            <ol style="text-align: center; list-style-position: inside; padding-bottom: 2rem;">
                <li>Recruit users to shop for $150 of plants (randomly assigned to Site A or B)</li>
                <li>Inspect and clean heroku logs for each user session</li>
                <li>Analyze time to completion and return rate for each user</li>
                <li>Aggregate user data with other users of the same site version</li>
                <li>Compute statistics (t-test and chi^2-test) for time to completion and return rate on each site</li>
            </ol>

		<div class="container-fluid">
            <hr class="mb-4">
            <p class="text-center">
                Below is an inforgraphic I created that shows the results of my statistical analyses.

            <p class = "text-center">Here are my main takeaways from this project: </p><br>
            <ol style="text-align: center; list-style-position: inside; padding-bottom: 2rem;">
                <li>Site design really matters and can impact user behavior!</li>
                <li>Visual clarity is key to good design. In Site B, the better performing site, users saw all necessary information at the same time.</li>
                <li>We could have collected better data if users had not seen other similar websites prior to testing.</li>
                <li>Another interesting aspect of the study could have been to measure user satisfaction with their shopping experience.</li>
